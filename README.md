Briefly describe your work on this project: What code did you receive, and what did you create yourself?

In Project Two, I authored code addressing the creation of each episode, epoch loops, determining the switch between random moves and the quality algorithm, referencing actions in the neural network for subsequent episodes, and defining win and loss states. The project provided pre-existing Keras and dependent libraries, along with the neural network's model structure. It also included controllers for default variables governing model parameters and the number of episodes to initiate the treasure hunter program.

Connect your learning across the course to the broader field of computer science:
What is the role of computer scientists, and why is it significant?

As a computer scientist, my role is to devise computer-based solutions that are both intuitive and efficient, contributing to the betterment of humanity. Throughout this course, I've expanded my understanding of AI and its place in the evolving field of computer science. This knowledge empowers me to introduce automation and simplicity to software projects through the implementation of AI. These solutions hold significance not only for me, the creator, but also for the individuals interacting with them. Recognizing this, I've gained insights into regulations like the EU's GDPR, which safeguard people and their data used in AI applications.

Approaching a problem as a computer scientist:
How do I tackle problems?

As a computer scientist, my approach involves questioning how I can enhance a solution, how it benefits others, exploring alternative, more effective solutions, and ensuring ethical considerations. By posing these questions, I can ensure the correctness, overall benefit, and ethical integrity of my solutions.

Ethical responsibilities to end users and organizations:
What are my ethical obligations?

In the realm of computer science, ethical responsibilities, especially concerning user data, are paramount. Regulations like the EU's GDPR underscore the importance of protecting individuals' data and its ethical utilization. As a computer scientist, safeguarding users' best interests is as crucial as crafting functional code. Ethics become particularly pivotal when handling user data, necessitating practices such as data minimization, anonymization when possible, and robust security measures to thwart unauthorized access.
